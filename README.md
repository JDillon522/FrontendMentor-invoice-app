## Overview
After getting frustrated playing with Web Components and subsequently throwing in the towel I decided to prove that I am actually pretty good at this web-dev thing and chose to jump to a complex Guru level project.

My goal is to build out the client side with mock data and then integrate a Nest.js api that I'll deploy on Heroku.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- ~~**Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)~~
- **Bonus**: Preserve state via a Nest.js API and postgres DB

## My process

- I started off by building a kitchen-sink page that has the design system laid out. Here I could see all (or most) of the different elements and knock out the layouts quickly.

**TODO**
- Once the design system is place I'll implement the layout and UI for the home page initially with some static data.
- I'll then integrate the dummy json data via a mock service
- From there its a matter of tons of form validation, routing, components, etc


### Built with

- **Angular**
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm still pretty damn good with Angular.
